#Runtime C# script engine for Unity3D

##Compile and execute C# code inside Unity3D scene at runtime!

UCompile is a system for compiling and executing strings with C# code inside Unity3D scenes at runtime. You can use it to allow players of your Unity3D game to modify your game with C# code, or as REPL engine, possibilities are restricted by only your imagination! For usage examples see <a href="#usage examples">usage examples chapter</a>. Works in editor and in build.

For now project works only on Windows, work in progress on OS X!
